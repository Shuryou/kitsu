<h1>Setting up For Macros</h1>

<h2>Disclaimer on Macros</h2>
<p>
On my pages, you will find macros I use personally. And it is to be noted. Macros have inherent lag in them. And what that means is that, they may not always be beneficial. So there may be adjustments you need to make in play style for them to work as intended. And even then, it may be "easier" but not necessarily "the best."
</p>

<h2>Menu Bar</h2>

<p>
Alright, so I have gotten the question (quite a few times) about my "Menu" that I use to swap classes, store mounts. Etc. So here is a guide to set that up (With pictures). **Note this is all for keyboard configuration**
</p>

<h3>The Theory</h3>
<p>
The theory is as follows: Most people only use 1-4 bars for their skills on any given class. By make 2 bars "shared" between all classes. that leaves us with at least 4 bars PER class that we can make standard bars and copy to the "shared" bars in order to create the illusion of a menu. <br/><br/>
A side note, I use this theory on some of my combat classes to make phase transitions easier, <br/>
Ex: Summoner has 3 burst phases, Dreadwyrm Trance, Summon Bahamut, and Phoenix. I use this theory of bar swapping to bring in relevant spells to each phase to limit how many buttons I need to memorize.

<h3>Step 1: The Settings</h3>
<p>
First Step is to setup your sharing hotbars. To do so open your character config->hotbar settings->sharing.
You want the following: Bars 1-3 unchecked. 4&5 checked. 6-10 unchecked. <br/><br/>
</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="menup1.png" width=649 height=517 alt="menu1"/>
</div>
<p>
**Note if you use more than 3 bars for any class, add that to the bars (so if you use 4 bars, uncheck 1-4, check 5&6, etc.**
</p>

<h3>Step 2: The Bars</h3>
<p>
So my menu is made up of multiple macros. The basic premise is this, you use the bars 6-10 on a specific class (I use gatherers) and then copy those bars to bars 4 and 5. So my primary one I do it with is Fisher.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="menup2.png" width=1247 height=571 alt="menu1"/>
</div>
<p>
In the image above I made bars 6-10 visible, normally they are invisible (hence why you don't see them when I stream)
</p>

<h3>Step 3: The Macros</h3>
<p>
Here is the meat of the menu. The macros. So the Plus functions to "open" the menu, Minus to "close" it.
</p>
<table class="ctable">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright">Macro Name</td>
		<td>&emsp; Macro Text</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright">Open Macro</td>
		<td>&emsp; /hotbar copy FSH 10 share 4<br/>&emsp; /hotbar display 5 on</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright"></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright">Close Macro</td>
		<td>&emsp; /hotbar display 5 off<br/>&emsp; /hotbar copy FSH 9 share 4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright"></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright">General Tab</td>
		<td>&emsp; /hotbar display 5 on<br/>&emsp; /hotbar copy BTN 9 share 5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright"></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright">Tank Tab</td>
		<td>&emsp; /hotbar copy FSH 8 share 5<br/>&emsp; /hotbar copy FSH 10 share 4<br/>&emsp; /hotbar display 5 on</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright"></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright">Healer Tab</td>
		<td>&emsp; /hotbar copy FSH 7 share 5<br/>&emsp; /hotbar copy FSH 10 share 4<br/>&emsp; /hotbar display 5 on</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright"></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright">DPS Tab</td>
		<td>&emsp; /hotbar copy FSH 6 share 5<br/>&emsp; /hotbar copy FSH 10 share 4<br/>&emsp; /hotbar display 5 on</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright"></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tdright">Crafter & Gatherer Tab</td>
		<td>&emsp; /hotbar copy BTN 10 share 5<br/>&emsp; /hotbar copy FSH 10 share 4<br/>&emsp; /hotbar display 5 on</td>
	</tr>
</table>
